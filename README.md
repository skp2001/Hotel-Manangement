# Project 1: Hotel-Website

[Click here](https://focused-thompson-2db155.netlify.app/index.html) for the live demo  of the website on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

> This is a Hotel Website to showcase the hotel's facility with a working contact form. This website can be used by any hotel as their informative website with a contact form to generate potential leads.

- This is a website of a hypothetical hotel `HBT`. This is a 3-page website. The `Home` section holds primary images of the hotel and a re-directory link to other pages.
The home section talks about the history of the hotel and the facilities it provides to its customers.

- The `About` section talks about the hotel and testimonials of the old customers.

- The `Contact` section has a working contact form with validation, that is created using Netlify form submission for data collection.

- Icons are used from `Font Awesome`.

- `Flexbox` is used for creating layouts.

- A request callback form is created with form validation that is created using `Netlify Forms` for data collection.

- The website is made `responsive` to all the devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones).

- CSS is precompiled using `SCSS` for the structured coding.

- The website is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

- The project is a part of the learning from [Brad Traversy](https://github.com/bradtraversy)'s course on Udemy. The idea credit is his. I have understood the concepts and learned them by building this on my own with a bare minimum reference of source code (only when my efforts couldn't clear the roadblock). The way of execution is modified as per my viewpoint whenever is necessary.
